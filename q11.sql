                Column1 is the drivers who have record on France or Monaco, they may have records on different circuits too. 
                Column2 is the drivers who have record on circuits other than France and Monaco. 
                If we take the drivers those are in column1 and not in column2, we will get drivers who hold record 'ONLY' in France or Monaco.
            After having LR, join it with other tables so that we can get the intended columns.
            Finally sort with respect to teams' short name. */
